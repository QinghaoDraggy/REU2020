# Optimal Stopping of exotic American option by Deep Learning (REU2020)

This repository contains the implementation for a project that was conducted during the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program in the summer of 2020 at the Mathematics Department of the University of Michigan. The project was supervised by Professor Shuoqing Deng and focused on using deep learning techniques for solving optimal stopping problems. 

The approach involved learning the optimal stopping rule directly from Monte Carlo samples. The project covers the theory, mathematical proof, and application of deep learning in this context. The effectiveness of this approach was tested on pricing Bermudan max-call and Asian options. Additionally, the project discusses using deep learning to improve the regression bases of the Longstaff-Schwartz algorithm. 

The project was funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and a report can be found on the department's website.
